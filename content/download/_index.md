[Quasar-1.11.1-Miniforge-x86_64.exe](https://download.biolab.si/download/files/quasar/Quasar-1.11.1-Miniforge-x86_64.exe) - an
installer that can be used without administrative privileges (64 bit).

When updating, remove the older version first. If there are any problems, also remove the corresponding Miniconda/Minifore and reinstall.

The package includes Python 3.11.8,
Orange 3.38.1, Orange-Spectroscopy 0.8.1, Orange-SNOM 0.0.4,
numpy 1.26.4, scipy 1.13.1, scikit-learn 1.5.2.

This installer used to be based on Miniconda, but since Anaconda changed their licensing terms, we switched to Miniforge in 1.10.2.

Version archive
===============

If needed, you can download previous versions from our [download archive](https://download.biolab.si/download/files/quasar/).

Other platforms
===============

With pip
--------

On other platforms, such as Linux, you will need a fairly recent python3 installation.
We highly recommend that you create a python virtual environment first. 
There, install Quasar with pip:

    pip install quasar
    
The above command will install all dependencies except PyQt. Install it with

    pip install PyQt6 PyQt6-WebEngine

Then, run Quasar with:

    python -m quasar

To open Bruker OPUS files, also install opusFC (only available for some platforms):

    pip install opusFC

With conda
----------

If you are using python provided by conda (we recommend obtaining it with Miniforge), you are almost ready to go.

As with pip, we highly recommend you create a separate environment for your Quasar installation.

Add two new channels:

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --add channels https://quasar.codes/conda/

and set the channel_priority recommended by [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html#how-to-fix-it):

    conda config --set channel_priority strict

and install the quasar package:

    conda install quasar

To open Bruker OPUS files, also install opusFC (only available for some platforms):

    conda install opusfc
